In this budget proposal, the JGSDF plans to purchase three types of Conventional Tactical Wheeled Vehicles (CTWVs) developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries based on the Type 16 Maneuverable Combat Vehicle. Among them, two variants of the Type 24 CTWV stand out:

18 samples of the armored combat wheeled infantry fighting vehicle (AWCV) version, worth 21.8 billion yen;
eight units of the mobile version of the 120 mm self-propelled mortar (MM), at a cost of Â¥8.3 billion.
Both options will begin to be implemented this year.

Six examples of the reconnaissance variant, worth 9 billion yen, were also ordered for the first time this year. These vehicles will be deployed from next year, although their official designation is yet to be confirmed. They will probably be called the Type 25 Reconnaissance Combat Vehicle.
